# CatBrains Islands Theme

A dark theme based on the [Solarized](https://ethanschoonover.com/solarized/) palette, built on JetBrains' latest Islands Theme architecture.

We've always preferred **Solarized** over pure black themes—it's just easier on the eyes. But when JetBrains moved to Islands, the Solarized options we relied on didn't keep up. So we built this.

If it finds its way to your screen and feels right, nothing would make us happier.
